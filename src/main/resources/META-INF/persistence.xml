            Is important to know that JPA requires a persistence unit where you can configure
        things, such as which managed classes are part of the persistence unit, how classes are
        mapped to database tables, datasource connections, and so forth. So, it is necessary
        create one. You can create the persistence.xml file in the resources/META-INF/ folder
